Repository for Entelect's University Cup Hackathon by 'Runtime Terrorists'. We were provided with files named 1 - 4 for each different level. The purpose of the challenge is to deliver food to each corresponding animal's space
using a drone, while avoiding dead zones and ensuring you have enough batteries for the drone to keep running. The required output for each level was to output a file with the required information according to the instructions given. All the files and source code used is contained in the zip file, and the main class used to run the program is shown as the Main.java file.
